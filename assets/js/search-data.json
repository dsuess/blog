            "content": "There are many things that make a great algorithm: Providing a solution to an actual problem is definitely important. Additional points if the algorithm is fast or easy to explain. However, not many algorithms contain a piece of life advice. . In this post, I&#39;ll talk about one algorithm that ticks all these boxes: the randomized truncated singular-value decomposition (SVD). I&#39;ll cover the idea and a basic implementation in 15 lines of Python. . Introduction . The singular value decomposition of a $m times n$ real matrix $M$ is a factorization . $$ M = U Sigma V^ mathrm{T}, $$where $ Sigma$ is a $r times r$ diagonal matrix with non-negative entries called singular values and $V^ mathrm{T}$ denotes the transpose of $V$. Additionally, the columns of $U in mathbb{R}^{m times r}$ and $V in mathbb{R}^{n times r}$ are orthonormal and called left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors, respectively. . One common use case of the SVD is principle component analysis (PCA), which is the most fundamental dimensionality reduction technique. The PCA can be computed using the SVD of the centered data matrix $X$, which has $N$ rows and each row represents one sample of a $n$ dimensional feature vector. $X$ being centered means that column means have been subtracted and are now equal to zero. . The relationship between SVD and PCA can be summarized as follows: Denote by $ sigma_1$ the largest singular value of $ frac{1}{ sqrt{N - 1}} X$ and by $V_1$ the corresponding right-singular vector. Then, $V_1$ gives the direction with the largest variance of the data and $ sigma_1$ is the explained variance in this direction. The right-singular vector $V_2$ of the next-largest singular value then represents the direction of largest variance in the dataset not explained by $V_1$, etc. In the case of a dataset with only $n = 2$ features, we can visualize these directions together with the original data points: . N = 200 samples = multivariate_normal(cov=np.array([[1, 0.4], [0.4, 1]])).rvs(size=N) df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;x&quot;: samples[:, 0], &quot;y&quot;: samples[:, 1]}) SVD = namedtuple(&quot;SVD&quot;, &quot;U, S, V&quot;) svd = SVD(*np.linalg.svd(samples / np.sqrt(N - 1))) scatter_plot = ( alt.Chart(df) .mark_point(shape=&quot;cross&quot;, size=40) .encode( x=alt.X(&quot;x&quot;, scale=alt.Scale(domain=(-2, 2))), y=alt.Y(&quot;y&quot;, scale=alt.Scale(domain=(-2, 2))), ) ).properties( width=400, height=400 ).interactive() df = pd.DataFrame({ &quot;x&quot;: [0, svd.S[0] * svd.V[0, 0], 0, svd.S[1] * svd.V[1, 0]], &quot;y&quot;: [0, svd.S[0] * svd.V[0, 1], 0, svd.S[1] * svd.V[1, 1]], &quot;Legend&quot;: [&#39;σ₁V₁&#39;, &#39;σ₁V₁&#39;, &#39;σ₂V₂&#39;, &#39;σ₂V₂&#39;] }) arrow_plot = ( alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode( x=&quot;x&quot;, y=&quot;y&quot;, detail=&quot;Legend&quot;, color=&quot;Legend&quot; ) ).interactive() alt.layer(scatter_plot, arrow_plot) . . For higher dimensional datasets, the first few largest singular values of $X$ and the corresponding singular vectors often capture a large fraction of the general properties of $X$. This combined with its simplicity makes PCA such a widely used tool for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. . The example of PCA highlights that for many use cases, computing the full SVD is unnecessary. Instead, the truncated SVD, i.e. computing the largest singular values and the corresponding singular vectors, is often sufficient. By only computing a small subset of the full SVD, the truncated SVD can also be much faster. However, efficient algorithms for truncated SVD such as Krylov subspace methods tend to be complex and challenging to implement. That&#39;s the reason why most scientific computing packages including Scipy are wrapping libraries like Arpack -- a more than 20 year old implementation in Fortran77. . This is where the randomized truncated SVD gets to shine: Not only can we implement a basic version in 15 lines of Python, that implementation also performs just as well as the much more intricate algorithm used in Scipy. And as the cherry on top, we even benefit from GPU acceleration using the same exact implementation in pytorch. . Randomized Truncated SVD . The idea behind randomized matrix decompositions is quite simple1: First, we need to find a $m times p$ matrix Q with orthonormal columns such that $$ M approx Q Q^{ mathrm{T}} M $$ We&#39;ll refer to this as the Q-condition. Next, we compute the (full) SVD for B $$ B = Q^{ mathrm{T}} M = hat U Sigma V. $$ The Q-condition now implies, that $U = Q hat U$ together with $ Sigma$ and $V$ is a SVD for $M$. To put this into words: We use the matrix $Q^{ mathrm{T}}$ to &quot;project&quot; $M$, compute the standard SVD of the projection, and then transform the right-singular vectors back using $Q$. . So why would this algorithm be any faster than simply computing the full SVD? Especially since we&#39;re computing the full SVD of $B$ as the second step. Indeed, the version presented above can only provide a speedup if $p$ is much smaller than $n$, and hence, $B$ has much fewer components than $M$. To make things worse, it turns out that with no further restrictions on $M$, the Q-condition is actually impossible2 to fulfill unless $p ge n$. However, if we are only interested in the $k$ largest singular values and the matrix $M$ fulfills certain technical conditions, the following construction fulfills a (slightly modified version) of the Q-condition for $p = k + 10$ with high probability1: . def randomized_range_finder(M, *, size, n_iter, n_oversamples=10): # Intialize Q randomly using Normal-distributed components Q = torch.randn(M.shape[1], size + n_oversamples, device=M.device) # Perform power-iteration a few times for i in range(n_iter): Q = M.transpose(-1, -2) @ (M @ Q) # Ortho-normalize the columns of Q Q, _ = torch.linalg.qr(M @ Q) return Q . As previously mentioned, the matrix $Q$ returned from randomized_range_finder requires $p$ to be only marginally larger than the number of singular values $k$ we are trying to compute. This results in a tremendous speed-up compared to the full PCA in case $k$ is much smaller than $n$ as commonly the case, e.g. for PCA. We will confirm this in the experiments section below. . Before we discuss the elephant in the room, namely the fact that above statement is only true with high probability, let us complete the implementation by turning the truncated SVD algorithm from the beginning of this section into code: . SVD = namedtuple(&quot;SVD&quot;, &quot;U, S, V&quot;) def randomized_svd(M, n_components): Q = randomized_range_finder(M, size=n_components, n_iter=7) # Project M B = Q.transpose(-1, -2) @ M # Compute full SVD of B Uhat, s, Vt = torch.linalg.svd(B) # Un-project U U = Q @ Uhat return SVD(U[:, :n_components], s[:n_components], Vt[:n_components, :]) . The qualifier &quot;with high probability&quot; for randomized_range_finder implies that there is a small chance that $Q$ computed in this way does not fulfill the Q-condition and the resulting truncated SVD is wrong. This probabilistic nature is in stark contrast to the majority of linear algebra algorithms, which are deterministic. It also implies that we can never be 100% sure that the result we obtained is correct. However, the reason why the randomized truncated SVD is so powerful in practice is that we have full control over its failure probability: We can make the failure probability smaller by increasing the constant in the formula for $p = k + ldots$. In fact, the choice $p = k + 10$ ensures that the probability of failure is so small that it can be considered to be zero for all practical purposes. In other words, even though there is a small chance of the algorithm failing, it is so small that we will never encounter this in practice. . And this is where a simple algorithm turns into life advise: If we require a solution for the truncated SVD that&#39;s perfect – both fast and 100% reliable – we end up with a very complex solution. The kind of solution I would have never chosen to write a blog post about voluntarily. However, by giving us a little bit of room for failure, we end up with a much more elegant and simple solution. And by controlling the probability of these failure cases, we can make sure that they remain a theoretical possibility only and and that they will never occur in practice. . Testing it out . As mentioned above, the randomized truncated SVD as it&#39;s implemented here works only if the matrix $M$ fulfills certain technical conditions. The most important one is that the singular values we&#39;re discarding are small enough such that they can be distinguished sufficiently easy from the singular values we&#39;re interested in. In practice this is often the case since otherwise we would not discard those singular values in the first place (e.g. in the case of PCA). There are also further improvements to the algorithm that make them more stable if this is not the case, and hence, these versions rely less on this assumption (see for example the implementation used in scikit-learn). . Here, we take the easy way out and simply generate matrices that fulfill these conditions using the following functions: . def sample_lowrank_matrix(size, max_rank, *, noise=0.0): A = torch.randn(size, max_rank) M = A @ A.transpose(-1, -2) / size + noise * torch.randn(size, size) return M . These are matrices that have only max_rank non-zero singular values in case noise == 0.0. If we set noise to some non-zero value, but keep it small enough, the singular values will still be sufficiently different for the truncated algorithm to work well. . M = sample_lowrank_matrix(1000, 5) svd_random = randomized_svd(M, 10) svd_standard = torch.linalg.svd(M) . def to_numpy(svd: SVD): return SVD(*map(lambda t: t.cpu().numpy(), svd)) def svd_flip(svd: SVD): max_abs_cols = torch.argmax(np.abs(svd.U), dim=0) signs = torch.sign(svd.U[max_abs_cols, range(svd.U.shape[1])]) svd.U[:] *= signs svd.V[:] *= signs[:, None] return svd def plot_singular_values(limit_ranks, **kwargs): kwargs = {name: to_numpy(val) for name, val in kwargs.items()} data = [ pd.DataFrame( { &quot;Rank&quot;: np.arange(len(svd.S))[:limit_ranks], &quot;Value&quot;: svd.S[:limit_ranks], &quot;Algorithm&quot;: name, } ) for name, svd in kwargs.items() ] data = pd.concat(data) return ( alt.Chart(data) .mark_point(size=40) .encode( x=&quot;Rank&quot;, y=alt.Y(&quot;Value&quot;, axis=alt.Axis(title=&quot;Singular Value&quot;)), color=&quot;Algorithm&quot;, shape=&quot;Algorithm&quot;, tooltip=[&quot;Algorithm&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;], ) ).interactive() def plot_singular_vector_errors(svd1, svd2, *, limit_ranks): svd1, svd2 = to_numpy(svd_flip(svd1)), to_numpy(svd_flip(svd2)) errors = np.linalg.norm(svd1.U[:, :limit_ranks] - svd2.U[:, :limit_ranks], axis=0) data = pd.DataFrame( { &quot;Rank&quot;: np.arange(len(errors)), &quot;Error&quot;:errors } ) return ( alt.Chart(data) .mark_line(color=&quot;gray&quot;, strokeDash=[2,2]) .encode( x=&quot;Rank&quot;, y=alt.Y( &quot;Error&quot;, axis=alt.Axis(title=&#39;Singular Vector Error&#39;, titleColor=&quot;gray&quot;), #scale=alt.Scale(domain=(0, 1.414)) ), tooltip=[&quot;Error&quot;], ) ).interactive() alt.layer( plot_singular_values(limit_ranks=10, **{&quot;SVD&quot;: svd_random, &quot;Randomized SVD&quot;: svd_standard}), plot_singular_vector_errors(svd_random, svd_standard, limit_ranks=10) ).resolve_scale(y=&quot;independent&quot;) . . This plot shows the singular values in descending order on the left y-axis using the x-axis to distinguish between them. We compute the singular values either using our truncated SVD implementation (blue circles) or using full SVD (orange squares). Both methods agree very well. Since we set max_rank for the matrix M to 5, only the first five singular values are nonzero. . The dotted line, which is scaled w.r.t. the right y-axis, shows the distance between the singular vectors computed with each method. As long as the singular values are non-zero both methods agree very well. However, for the vanishing singular values, the corresponding singular vectors show a very large discrepancy. This is due to the fact that there&#39;s no natural order for the vanishing singular values anymore and the $i$-th singular vector computed with one method does not need to match with the $i$-th singular vector computed with a different method3. . Finally, let us compare the performance of different approaches. In the plot below we compare the runtime for a variety matrix sizes for different approaches: . &quot;cpu&quot; is the randomized algorithm implemented above run on CPU | &quot;gpu&quot; is the randomized algorithm implemented above run on GPU | &quot;full&quot; is the standard SVD included in pytorch run on CPU | &quot;scipy&quot; is the truncated SVD scipy.sparse.svds | . All runtimes were measured on a Colab GPU instance with a Nvidia T4 and 2 CPU cores. You may need to zoom out to see the times for &quot;full&quot; and very large matrix sizes. . matrix_sizes = [2**8, 2**9, 2**10, 2**11, 2**12] results = defaultdict(list) results[&#39;sizes&#39;] = matrix_sizes n_components = 2 for size in matrix_sizes: M = sample_lowrank_matrix(size, 3) time = %timeit -o -q randomized_svd(M, n_components=n_components) results[&#39;cpu&#39;].append(time.best) for size in matrix_sizes: M = sample_lowrank_matrix(size, 3) time = %timeit -q -o torch.svd(M) results[&quot;full&quot;].append(time.best) for size in matrix_sizes: M = sample_lowrank_matrix(size, 3).numpy() time = %timeit -q -o svds(M, k=n_components) results[&quot;scipy&quot;].append(time.best) if torch.cuda.is_available(): for size in matrix_sizes: M = sample_lowrank_matrix(size, 3) time = %timeit -q -o randomized_svd(M.cuda(), n_components=n_components) results[&quot;gpu&quot;].append(time.best) df = pd.DataFrame({**results, &quot;k&quot;: n_components}) value_vars = list(filter(lambda s: s not in {&quot;sizes&quot;, &quot;k&quot;}, df.columns)) df = df.melt(id_vars=[&quot;sizes&quot;, &quot;k&quot;], value_vars=value_vars) df.rename(columns={&quot;value&quot;: &quot;runtime&quot;, &quot;variable&quot;: &quot;algorithm&quot;}, inplace=True) ( alt.Chart(df) .mark_point(size=40) .encode( x=alt.X(&quot;sizes&quot;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;sqrt&#39;, zero=False), axis=alt.Axis(title=&quot;Matrix Size&quot;)), y=alt.Y(&quot;runtime&quot;, scale=alt.Scale(domain=(0, 0.55)), axis=alt.Axis(title=&quot;Runtime [s]&quot;)), color=&quot;algorithm&quot;, shape=&quot;algorithm&quot;, ) ).interactive() . . Note that for all truncated SVDs, we set $k=2$, that is we only computed the two largest singular values. Naturally, for larger values of $k$ the difference between the full SVD and the truncated versions would become smaller. . We clearly save a lot of time simply by using an algorithm that only computes the necessary singular values and vectors. For the largest matrix size, we see a speedup of over 50x between the full SVD and our simple implementation run on CPU. When we compare the slowest version to the randomized truncated SVD run on GPU, we see an even larger speedup of over 400x. . Conclusion . I hope this blog post could convey why I consider the randomized truncated SVD as my favorite algorithm. It solves a very common and important problem, it&#39;s fast, it easily runs on GPUs, and it&#39;s simple enough to explain in a few minutes. But the most important factor is the insight it provides into the power of probabilistic algorithms in general: If we give up the requirement that an algorithm should work 100% of the time in theory, we have a lot to gain in simplicity and performance. And as long as failure is unlikely enough, it will not make a difference in practice. So stop worrying and start loving the possibility of failure. . 1. N. Halko, P.-G. Martinsson, and J. A.

            "title": "From Scratchː Neural Network Inference on FPGAs – Part 2",
            "content": "Now that the last post covered how to build the example for emulation and hardware deployment, we are now ready to go in a bit more detail. This post will go over this simple baseline implementation for a 2 layer fully connected network running inference on FPGAs. . Contents . Part 1: How to build FPGA applications on AWS Part 2: A baseline implementation for fully connected networks (this post) . Code walkthrough . The model we’re trying to run is as simple as it gets. Two fully connected layers; the first one ReLu-activated and the second (and final) layer with a softmax activation. . class FCNN: def __init__(self, input_size: int, num_classes: int): self.layer1 = Dense(input_size, 64) self.layer2 = Dense(64, num_classes) def __call__(self, x: Tensor) -&gt; Tensor: y = x y = self.layer1(y).relu6() return self.layer2(y).logsoftmax() . This means we’ll need to implement the following three kernels: . matrix-matrix multiplication | bias-addition + ReLu non-linearity | bias-addition + softmax non-linearity | . The reason for separating the matrix-multiplication and bias-addition operations into two kernels is that the former is likely going to be the biggest performance bottleneck. Therefore, keeping them separated will make experimentation with different matrix-multiplication implementation easier later on. Also, fusing the bias-addition and non-linearity functions into a single kernel will likely be beneficial for performance. Both operations are relatively fast, so the additional overhead from launching a kernel will be more noticeable. Both operations also have a low computation-to-memory-transfer ratio, and hence, benefit from reducing the memory access by executing both bias-addition and non-linearity in one pass. . The structure of the model is also duplicated for the C++ implementation in the net.hpp file, which we will cover later. . Kernel implementations . The first and simplest kernel we’ll write is the bias + ReLu6 kernel. Thanks to the HLS using C++ and not including any optional, FPGA-specific code, the first baseline implementation looks like standard C++ code . extern &quot;C&quot; void bias_relu6_kernel(float *const activation, const float *const bias, const uint batch_size, const uint dim) { for (uint b = 0; b &lt; batch_size; b++) { for (uint d = 0; d &lt; dim; d++) { const uint ia = dim * b + d; activation[ia] = relu6(activation[ia] + bias[d]); } } } . The implementation for the bias + softmax kernel is very similar. Note that the result is computed inplace using activation both as an input and an output. This is not possible for the matrix-multiplication kernel since the shape of either input and the output can be different. Hence, we need to allocate sufficient memory outside of the kernel and pass in a pointer using the additional out argument. The naive implementation using three for-loops is certainly not optimal and will need to be revisited later: . extern &quot;C&quot; void matmul_kernel(const float *const matrixA, const float *const matrixB, const uint rowsA, const uint colsA, const uint colsB, float *const out) { for (uint i = 0; i &lt; rowsA; ++i) { for (uint j = 0; j &lt; colsB; ++j) { // Nulling result here causes issues when running in hw-emu mode. // Looks like io isn&#39;t updated &quot;in time&quot; const uint io = colsB * i + j; for (uint k = 0; k &lt; colsA; ++k) { const uint ia = colsA * i + k; const uint ib = colsB * k + j; out[io] += matrixA[ia] * matrixB[ib]; } } } } . The output array out should be initialized to zero outside of the kernel and all arrays are assumed to store their elements in row-major order. . Host application . So far, we’ve implemented all the code that will “run” on the FPGA device. The rest, which makes up the majority of the code, is for the host-device (CPU) and needed for memory management as well as dispatching the kernels. . The Matrix class abstracts away the memory management as well as the host-device memory transfers. One major constraint for using Vitis is that all memory copied to or from the FPGA device needs to be page-aligned on the host device, i.e. both the starting address and memory size have to be divisible by page size. For this, we use a custom allocator with DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT being hard coded to the page size 4096: . template &lt;typename T&gt; T *aligned_alloc(std::size_t num, std::size_t alignment = DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT) { void *ptr = nullptr; if (posix_memalign(&amp;ptr, alignment, num * sizeof(T))) { throw std::bad_alloc(); } return reinterpret_cast&lt;T *&gt;(ptr); } . The functions to_device and to_cpu handle memory transfer between the host and the device. We implement move-semantics for the Matrix class by implementing special constructors and the =-operator to allow for copy-free return values from functions. Finally, the two helper functions at the bottom of matrix.hpp abstract the OpenCL kernel-dispatch overhead for us. For example, the apply_matmul function applies the matmul_kernel to two Matrix instances: . std::pair&lt;Matrix, cl::Event&gt; apply_matmul(Matrix &amp;matrixA, Matrix &amp;matrixB, cl::Kernel &amp;kernel, std::vector&lt;cl::Event&gt; *wait_on = NULL, DeviceHandle &amp;handle = HANDLE) { Matrix result = Matrix::constant(matrixA.rows, matrixB.cols, 0.0, 4096); result.to_device(handle); kernel.setArg(0, matrixA.get_buffer()); kernel.setArg(1, matrixB.get_buffer()); kernel.setArg(2, matrixA.rows); kernel.setArg(3, matrixA.cols); kernel.setArg(4, matrixB.cols); kernel.setArg(5, result.get_buffer()); cl::Event event; handle.q.enqueueTask(kernel, wait_on, &amp;event); return std::make_pair(std::move(result), event); } . Since OpenCL provides an async API, we do not simply invoke the kernel, but we enqueue the task of running the kernel in a command queue. This task may depend on other previously enqueued tasks, which can be expressed using the (optional) wait_on argument. A reference to the newly invoked task is returned as the second return value of type cl::Event. Only after this task is processed does the return value result contain the computed value. To see how this is used, take a look at the forward-pass of the network: . Matrix operator()(Matrix &amp;input) { std::vector&lt;cl::Event&gt; events; events.resize(3); Matrix y; std::tie(y, events[0]) = apply_matmul(input, weight1, MATMUL_KERNEL); . The matrix-multiplication in the first layer is independent of any operation. Therefore, we do not pass the wait_on argument in this line. The event-result is then assigned to the first entry of the events vector and duplicated in the following lines to make sure every entry of events is a valid cl::Event instance: . events[1] = events[0]; events[2] = events[0]; events[1] = apply_bias(y, bias1, BIAS_RELU6_KERNEL, &amp;events); . A pointer to this vector is then passed on to the bias-activation part of the first layer since it depends on the prior matrix-multiplication to finish. A similar effect can be achieved by only allocating a vector of size one at this point, but then we would have to resize the vector after each additional operation. The following lines then apply the second layer of the network accordingly. . std::tie(y, events[2]) = apply_matmul(y, weight2, MATMUL_KERNEL, &amp;events); apply_bias(y, bias2, BIAS_SOFTMAX_KERNEL, &amp;events); return y; } . Now we are ready to look at the high-level implementation in main.cpp: . int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) { init_kernels(); auto model = FCNN(&quot;weights/&quot;); auto input = Matrix::from_npy(&quot;weights/samples.npy&quot;); input.to_device(); . The first call to init_kernels loads the OpenCL kernels from a separate binary file and stores references to them in global variables. Next, we load the model weights from separate .npy files, one for each tensor. Finally, we also load the input samples that we will feed into the model. These .npy files are prepared by the train script and stored as float32 arrays. . Next, we run the model, wait for all OpenCL events to finish, and copy the result back from the device to the host: . auto result = model(input); finish_cl_queue(); result.to_cpu(); finish_cl_queue(); . Finally, for each element in the batch, we compute the argmax of the confidence scores to get the final prediction and print it to stdout: . // print argmax result for (int i = 0; i &lt; result.rows; i++) { float minval = -1; int idx = -1; for (int j = 0; j &lt; result.cols; j++) { auto val = result(i, j); if (minval &lt; val) { idx = j; minval = val; } } std::cout &lt;&lt; idx &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;; } std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl; } . In the next posts we will look at the performance characteristics of this baseline implementation and how to improve both latency as well as reduce the resource requirements. .

            "content": "Deploying your deep learning models directly to edge devices comes with many advantages compared to traditional cloud deployments: Eliminating communication can reduce latency and reliance on the network connection; since the data never leaves the device, edge-inference helps maintaining user privacy; and since the amount of cloud resources is drastically reduced, edge-inference can also reduce ongoing costs. The proliferation of ML running on edge devices both drives and is driven by the development of specialized hardware accelerators such as GPUs, ASICs, or FPGAs. For an overview over the advantages and disadvantages of each hardware type see this series of posts or this article. . In this series of posts we will go over how to run inference for simple neural networks on FPGA devices. As the title “from scratch” suggests, the main focus is on getting to know FPGA programming better and slightly lower its traditionally high barrier of entry. This first post will go over the basic development by means of a simple example application running inference on a 2 layer fully connected network. By using AWS’s F1-instances and their provided AMI with all the necessary software, all you need to follow is an AWS account. With minor changes the example should also run on most Xilinx FPGAs. . Contents . Part 1: How to build FPGA applications on AWS (this post) Part 2: A baseline implementation for fully connected networks . Programming FPGAs . One of the main challenges of using FPGAs is that their programming model is fundamentally different to most other “programming”: Instead of generating instructions that are run by a processing unit, programming an FPGA means programming the actual hardware. For this to make sense, we first need to understand what an FPGA is. Highly simplified, an FPGA consist of many programable logic blocks such as look-up tables (LUT), memory, and reconfigurable connections between those building blocks. Re-configuring the behavior of the logic blocks and the connections between them allows us to implement different digital circuits. So the final “program” can be thought of a schematic that is implemented by the FPGA. . Traditionally FPGAs are programmed using a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL. These are quite different from popular programming languages, which is one major reason for the perceived high barrier of entry for FPGA programming. This barrier has been considerable lowered with the introduction of high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, which allow writing code for FPGAs in more mainstream languages such as C/C++. As it’s commonly the case, this increased abstraction and simplicity often comes at the cost of reduced efficiency of the resulting circuits. Therefore, for performance-critical implementations a good understanding of the underlying hardware layer is essential. . For our first implementation we will use Xilinx’ Vitis platform based on OpenCL: An OpenCL device such as an FPGA executes small programs called “kernels”. These kernels are managed and launched by the host device (CPU). By implementing these kernels using HLS, the implementation for FPGA looks remarkably close to what a similar implementation for CPUs would look like. The main difference is that the FPGA kernels are not simply instructions that are processed like on a CPU, but they are implemented as digital circuits on the device. So for example, if we want to run parts of the code in parallel, we can’t just run it in parallel on multiple cores; instead, we need to duplicate the physical circuit on the FPGA. . Note that Xilinx’ Vitis AI platform provides a ready-to-use runtime for common network architectures such as Resnets for image classification and single-stage object detectors such as SSD and Yolo. However, as of writing of this post, AWS F1 instances are not supported. In the future, I’d like to see how close simple implementations of the necessary layers can get to such a reference implementation efficiency-wise. . Setting up the development environment . The code accompanying this post can be found on GitHub. It this first technical part, we will go over how to run it. As the necessary software does not seem to be freely available, we will use the FPGA Developer AMI on AWS. You will need an AWS account with payments setup as free-tier machines are not powerful enough for this purpose. . The build scripts in this example are based on the official Vitis tutorials. However, these do not work out-of-the-box in AWS’ FPGA environment and require two changes: . the PLATFORM variable needs to be set to $AWS_PLATFORM – an environment variable that set by the FPGA AMI, | the FPGA memory bank used needs to be changed in hardware-emulation mode. | . The last sentence already brings us to one important point when it comes to working with FPGAs: Synthesizing the program for an actual hardware device can take a long time, even multiple hours and even for simple designs. That’s the reason why we will make extensive use of two different types of emulation. . First, in software-emulation mode, the kernels are compiled to native code and run directly on the CPU. On one hand, this makes it very fast to compile and ideal during feature development to achieve a fast development cycle. On the other hand, as actual schematic-synthesis is not necessary for this step, certain errors will not show up in software emulation. Second, there is hardware-emulation mode that runs an actual synthesized schematic on a simulated device. As this simulation is quite detailed, hardware-emulation runs much slower than software emulation. It also adds additional compile time to the development cycle, but is still considerably faster than compiling for an actual FPGA. On the plus side, hardware-emulation allows not just for functionality testing, but also allows probing the performance characteristics and resources demands for running on a physical device. . As neither emulation mode requires an FPGA, most development work can (and should) be done on a beefy CPU-only machine saving a lot of money in the process. We will only require an FPGA instance for the last bit of testing. . Setting up the EC2 instance . As mentioned in the previous section, most of the development work does not require an FPGA instance and can be done on general purpose instance types. To follow this tutorial, you will need an S3 bucket (named fpga-storage here) and an EC2 instance with . the AWS FPGA Developer AMI loaded, | at least 16GB of RAM (e.g. m5.xlarge instance type or larger to speed up emulation), | an IAM role with read/write access to the S3 bucket and the following permissions: DescribeFpgaImageAttribute DescribeFpgaImages CopyFpgaImage CreateFpgaImage DeleteFpgaImage ModifyFpgaImageAttribute ResetFpgaImageAttribute . | . In the remainder of this section we provide step-by-step instructions how to launch the required instance. Experienced AWS users can skip ahead to the next section. . Create a new S3 bucket from the S3 management console. Set the name to fpga-storage and keep the default values for the remaining options. | From the IAM Policy creation create a new policy. | For service select “S3”; for actions select “ListBucket”, “GetObject”, “PutObject”, and “DeleteObject”, and for resources select “Any” for all fields except “bucket”, for which you set the bucket-name to “fpga-storage”: | Click “Add additional permissions” and add the following permissions (also listed above) for the “EC2” service: | Continue through the screens until you end up on the “Review policy” screen. Enter “FpgaDevPolicy” as the name and finalize the role creation. | You can now use the IAM role creation to create a new role. | Select “AWS Services” → “EC2” as the trusted entity from the next screen. | Choose the newly created “FpgaDevPolicy” from the list and continue until you reach the “Review role” screen. Enter the name “FpgaDevRole” and finalize the role creation. | From the EC2 console, click “Launch instance”. | In the AMI search bar, enter “FPGA” and select the AWS Marketplace from the menu on the left. Select the “FPGA Developer AMI” by AWS from the list. | Continue to the instance selection step. Choose the m5.xlarge instance type and click the “Next: Configure instance details” button. | Choose the created “FpgaDevRole” for the IAM role entry. Click “Add storage”. | Delete the additional EBS volume and raise the size of the root partition to 200GB. | Click “Review and Launch” and “Launch the instance”. | If necessary, setup ssh authentication and ssh into the new instance using public IP displayed in AWS: | $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY centos@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx . Setting up the environment . Now that we are connected to the EC2 instance with the FPGA developer tools, we need to install some additional requirements: . $ sudo yum install cmake3 jq $ git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga ~/src/project_data/aws-fpga . The second line clones a repo with some additional helper scripts from AWS’ official github repo. We mainly need it to setup the development environment on the machine by running . $ source ~/src/project_data/aws-fpga/vitis_setup.sh . Note that the above command needs to be run every time when logging into the machine as it modifies the shell environment. . Running the examples . We are now ready to run the examples on this machine. For this, we are going to follow the normal development cycle: software emulation, hardware emulation, and finally compiling for the hardware device. To follow the following examples, you’ll need to clone the example repo . $ git clone https://github.com/dsuess/nn-on-fpgas -b part-1-v1 --recursive &amp;&amp; cd nn-on-fpgas . Software Emulation . The fastest way to run the examples is using software emulation. This compiles the kernels to native code and circumvents the circuit-synthesis completely. In the build scripts, the compilation mode is controlled through the TARGET variable, which has three possible values sw_emu, hw_emu, and hw. To compile the example in software emulation, we can simply run . $ mkdir build_sw &amp;&amp; cd build_sw &amp;&amp; cmake3 -DTARGET=sw_emu .. &amp;&amp; make main kernels tests emconfig.json . In case this command raises an error, please make sure you followed the setup instructions above. This builds all the necessary targets in the build_sw subdirectory: . main builds example program, | tests builds test suite for the kernels, and | kernels builds the kernel binary xclbin/kernels.xclbin, and | emconfig.json contains information on the target hardware platform. The kernels (i.e. the basic mathetmatical operations that should run on the FPGA) are loaded by the application at runtime. We will look at these in more detail in the next part of this series. | . We can now run the test or the example application: . $ XCL_EMULATION_MODE=sw_emu ./tests $ XCL_EMULATION_MODE=sw_emu ./main . The latter should print 0 1 2 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 in the last line. These are the class-predictions of the model when running on images for the classes 0 to 9. The accuracy of the model is around 94% which is the reason we see a mistake for the label 3. . Hardware emulation . Building the kernels for hardware emulation simply requires changing the TARGRT variable: . $ mkdir build_hw &amp;&amp; cd build_hw &amp;&amp; cmake3 -DTARGET=hw_emu .. &amp;&amp; make kernels tests emconfig.json . This command should be run from the root directory of the git repo. Note that compilation takes much longer compared to software emulation mode. The same is true for running the examples, which is why we only run the tests in hardware emulation: . XCL_EMULATION_MODE=hw_emu ./tests . Besides the binaries, hardware emulation also produces detailed reports on resource utilization and suggested changes in _x/reports. We will come back to these diagnostics in a later part of this series. . Running on FPGA . Finally, we are now in a position to run the example on an actual FPGA hardware device: . $ mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build &amp;&amp; cmake3 -DTARGET=hw .. &amp;&amp; make kernels . This step will only build the kernel binary in xclbin/kernels.xclbin and may take over one hour to finish. If you don’t want to wait that long, we provide a finished version of the binary as a Github Release. On a standard Xilinx system we could directly run the kernels from the xclbin file. However, AWS requires on additional step, namely converting the xclbin to an Amazon FGPA image (AFI). The build steps are outlined in the offical AWS FPGA repo. First, we need to set the default region to be used for the following commands to a region that supports FPGA instances (here us-east-1) . $ aws configure set default.region us-east-1 . Now we can create the AFI image and save it to the S3 bucket fpga-storage, which we created during the initial environment setup: . $ $VITIS_DIR/tools/create_vitis_afi.sh -xclbin=xclbin/kernels.xclbin -o=xclbin/kernels -s3_bucket=fpga-storage -s3_dcp_key=kernels -s3_logs_key=logs . This will create a xclbin file xclbin/kernels.awsxclbin, which should be loaded by the runtime instead of the xclbin/kernels.xclbin when running on F1 instances. In our standard runtime, this is automatically done based on compile time flags. We copy this file to the S3 bucket for later use. . $ aws s3 cp xclbin/kernels.awsxclbin s3://fpga-storage/ . Additionally, there’s should be a *_afi_id.txt file created that contains the AFI ID. Using the AFI ID, we can check the status of the conversion processes running in the background: . $ export AFI_ID=$(cat *_afi_id.txt | jq -r &quot;.FpgaImageId&quot;) $ aws ec2 describe-fpga-images --fpga-image-ids $AFI_ID . Note that when running the create_vitis_afi.sh script multiple times, multiple files that fit the glob-pattern of the first command will be in the directory. Either choose the correct one by hand or delete all of them and re-run the script. Once the state code outputted by the describe-fpga-images command changes from “pending” to “available”, we are ready to finally run the example on an FPGA hardware device. For this, follow the original setup steps, but choose an F1-instance type. After cloning the example repo, we need to build everything except the kernels . $ mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build &amp;&amp; cmake3 -DTARGET=hw .. &amp;&amp; make emconfig.json main tests . We can simply copy the AFI kernel binary from S3 . $ mkdir xclbin &amp;&amp; aws s3 cp s3://fpga-storage/kernels.awsxclbin xclbin/ . And run both the tests and the example application on the FPGA: . $ ./tests $ ./main . Conclusion . This finished the first post in the “From Scratch: Neural Network Inference on FPGAs” series, which covered the basics in how to develop applications for FPGAs. In the next post we will look at the implementation in a bit more detail. . Cover Image by Pedant01 CC BY-SA 4.0 .",
